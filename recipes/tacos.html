                     This recipe takes a little time but it's so worth it!
                     Birria, a.k.a. tacos de birria, is a Mexican dish of meat (usually goat or beef) stewed in its braising liquid until it reaches a melt-in-your-mouth texture.
                     Traditionally, it gets its flavor from dried chile peppers. Birria can be served alone as a stew or on corn tortillas.

                           <strong> Dried chile peppers: </strong>
                            The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chiles.
                             For a bit of extra heat, don't remove all the seeds.
